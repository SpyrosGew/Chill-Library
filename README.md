CHILL LIBRARY

Unfinished Project for web development course in Harokopio University

The client has 2 actions one where someone can search a book from a sqlite database with a keyword or add a new book (the database is specified at the init function of books.js also the database nor the table of the books are created in the code. The database and table should already be there, the backend just performs those 2 actions)
